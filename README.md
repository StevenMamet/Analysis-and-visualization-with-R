Here I've included a number of R scripts for making pretty figures with R.

Full disclosure: I love how the tidyverse has made manipulating R data a dream, but I'm very much not in love with making figures with ggplot. I use it when I have to, but still prefer base R over ggplot for making figures. Don't @ me.

Check out the wiki for the code and examples.
